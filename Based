<h3>Who is Lil B?</h3>
    Lil B is a rapper from Berkeley California born in 1989. As a kid he had a strong desire to be a musician so when it came
time for Brandon (Lil B) to go to high school he joined a rap group known as The Pack. The Pack immediately started producing
local hits such as "Vans" or "In My Car". After The Pack had its shine Lil B decided to pursue his career as a solo musician.
Brandon always looked at life with a very positive attitude, this later led him to call that very mentality "Based". From that
point forward he strived to be one thing, the "Based God". To Lil B the Based God had no flaws, "the Based God is perfect" - Lil B.
He found himself in the music studios recording songs with such vast levels of positivity he discovered that he is able to communicate
directly to the Based God and display his messages for all to hear. After much communication with the Based God, Lil B was ready to
publish his first mixtape, "I'm Thraxx". Since this mixtape has released Lil B has released 48 independent projects with a total of over
3000 songs to his name, all producing the Based image in a variety of different styles.
